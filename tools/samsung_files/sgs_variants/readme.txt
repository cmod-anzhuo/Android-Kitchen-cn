This folder is for variants of the Samsung Galaxy S, so that the kitchen will recognize your device as a Galaxy S I9000.

In your /system/build.prop file there is a parameter called ro.product.device. The value of this parameter will be used as the name of the file to be placed in this folder.  This file can be empty; the kitchen will not read its contents.
